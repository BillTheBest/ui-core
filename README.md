# ManyWho UI Core

Core javascript services used by the [ManyWho](https://manywho.com) UI framework to do the heavy lifting.

## Usage

### Building

To build the ui core you will need to have [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/), [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) and [typings](https://github.com/typings/typings) installed.

Then install dependencies:

```
npm install
typings install
```

Then run the dev build `gulp dev-ts` or dist build `gulp dist-ts`

### Running

You can run `gulp watch` which will re-run the `dev-ts` task whenever a change to the script files is made.
